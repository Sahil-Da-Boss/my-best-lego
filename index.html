	<p align="center">The company Lego was created in Denmark when a poverty stricken man<br>
	looking for new ways to make money.He realized he had to come up with an <br>
	idea that would make him money. That was when LEGO came about! For decades this idea <br>
	would continue to grow and achieve greatness!</p>
</div>
	<h1 align="center">When I started</h1>
	<p align="center">I started when I was about 7 years old! I always loved legoes since then. Most people <br>
	that you just build the set and then you're done with it but in reality, you can take it apart <br>
	and build your own thing. I have always enjoyed lego sets because they are hours of endless fun! <br>
	I would encourage these products for people from ages 5-15 although many people older than this still <br>
	enjoy legos.</p>
