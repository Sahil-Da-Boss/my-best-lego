	<p align="center">
		Currently, I am 13 years old. I have many interests but foremost among them is math. I enjoy doing problem solving math, where you are given a real world problem, and you are asked to solve it. My favorite math problems which I like to do are math olympiad problems. These problems require pure logic and math to solve them. You can't ude the calculator and you have to solve the problems as quick as you can. This really tests your logic and helps you get better at math. I am also interested in robotics and plan to continue that in high school.
