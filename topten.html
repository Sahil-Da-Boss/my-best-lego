		There are a variety of lego sets but I have chosen ten that I like <br>

	<h1 align="center">1. Temple of Airjitsu</h1>
	<p align="center">
		This lego set might be a little overpriced, but summing up all of the features and minifigures, I would recommend to get this set when it becomes on sale. It currently costs $199.99 in the US.

	<h1 align="center">3.The Lion CHI Temple</h1>
	<p align="center">
		If you are looking for a good base type of lego set this one is perfect for you. Its price ranges from $200-$210. It is a little on the expensive side but it is an outstanding build and I am sure you will enjoy building it.

	<h1 align="center">4. King's Castle</h1>
	<p align="center">
		This set is an amazing set if you are looking for a nice old fashion castle. Most of the minifigures in this set are knights in armor. The knights come with armor peices which are very nice details. I especially like the build of the set. The castle is very nice with amazing features such as catapults and various traps.

	<h1 align="center">5. Fire Station(Lego city)</h1>
	<p align="center">
		This set is an amazing set to buy. It says fire station, but you can practically use it or anything. You can use it as a base for some superheroes, or a base for some supervillains. This has a very nice design and looks very good from the outside. It also comes with a nice helicopter and a truck. All in all, this is a very good set to buy. This set is priced at $99.99 which is a decent price for what you are getting.
